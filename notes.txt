Current Issues:

- laughing also passes the threshold for sleepiness for eyes.

- use the same logic for mouth detection also : yawning one
(Parul: what's the update on threshold ?)

- what if there's mask on the mouth Nikki?
We could also see the if the car is moving in straight line or zigzag motion ? Is it possible ?

- alarm sound is annoying, should we change it or do we want the annoying one? 
annoying sound will definitely wake someone up (hehe)

- swasti : please update the issues
